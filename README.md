# Wine_Customer_Segmentation__Clustering

## Purpose


The purpose of this analysis is to better understand customers of a winery to determine the best offers to make to them.    i.e. this provides a better customer experience for the winery's customers--by communicating more relevant products to them, and also aims to improve revenue for the winery by increasing purchases from customers.

It leverages a data set (excel file) with information about the offers the winery made and purchases made by customers. We aim to create segements of customers with similar behaivour, leveraging these two data sets.
